# Project Blueprint

## Overview

This project provides AI-powered tools for both teachers and students to enhance the learning and teaching experience.

## Implemented Features

*   **Teacher & Student Features:** Includes dashboards, a question paper generator, a learning chapter creator, a presentation coach, paper comparison, and answer evaluation tools.
*   **AI-Powered Chatbot:** An integrated AI assistant for teachers.
*   **Student Dashboard Enhancements:** Redesigned UI with stat cards and placeholders for "My Learning Library" and "Goals & Progress".

## New Features

### 1. Save Generated Chapters & Quizzes

**Plan:**

1.  **Create a new API route** at `src/app/api/student/chapters/route.ts` to handle saving chapter data (flashcards and quizzes) to MongoDB.
2.  **Add a "Save Chapter" button** to the `learning-creator` page that appears after generation.
3.  **Implement the save functionality** in `src/app/student/learning-creator/page.tsx` to send the chapter data to the new API endpoint.
4.  **Provide user feedback** upon successful save or if an error occurs.
